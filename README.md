TextTest Runner Maven artifact
==============================

This maven artifact simply wraps a texttest release in such a way as maven can handle it as a jar file.
To use this texttest runner, you need to unpack the jar, and put source/bin on your $PATH. It's not a Java program.

This repo is designed to be used together with the texttest-maven-plugin.
